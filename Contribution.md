# Contributions
  -We (Aditi and Prakriti) equally contributed to the project in all aspects. 
  -Prakriti did the initial research and tried using a basic CNN classifier and also tried some data augmentation techniques as the data was biased. 
  -Aditi then built on top of it with better models as well as helped in documenting and gave ideas to further fine-tune the models.
